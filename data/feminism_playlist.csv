Somethin' that's far above average."" And maybe other rhyming words like cabbage and savage And baby carriage and other things that match it Couple of things are happenin' here First he's relatin' the word bitch with his mama - comma And because she's relatin' to herself As most important source of help And mental health he may skew respect for dishonor Bitch bad woman good Lady better they misunderstood (I'm killin' these bitches) Uh tell 'em bitch bad Woman good lady better They misunderstood They misunderstood Yeah now imagine a group of little girls 9 through 12 On the Internet watching videos Listening to songs by themselves It doesn't really matter if they have parental clearance They understand the Internet better than their parents Now being the Internet the content's probably uncensored They're young so they're malleable and probably unmentored A complicated combination maybe with no relevance Until that intelligence meets their favorite singer's preference ""Bad bitches bad bitches bad bitches That's all I want and all I like in life is bad bitches bad bitches.""

affects our whole community Now Brenda really never knew her moms and her dad Was a junky went in debt into his arms it's sad Cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know Just 'cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow But oh that's a thought-my own revelation Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation Brenda got herself a boyfriend Her boyfriend was her cousin now let's watch the joy end She tried to hide her pregnancy from her family Who didn't really care to see or give a damn if she Went out and had a church of kids As long as when the check came they got first dibs Now Brenda's belly's gettin' bigger But no one seems to notice any change in her figure She's twelve years old guess she's havin' a baby In love with a molester who's sexin' her crazy And yet in all she thinks that he'll be with her forever And dreams of a world where the two of 'em are together Whatever he left her and she had the baby solo She had it on the bathroom floor and didn't know so She didn't know what to throw away and what to keep She wrapped the baby up and threw him in a trash heep I guess she thought she'd get away wouldn't hear the cries She didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes Now the baby's in the trash heep ballin' Mama can't help him but it hurts to hear him callin' Brenda wants to run away Mama say You making me lose pay a social worker's here everyday Now Brenda's gotta make her own way Can't go to her family they won't let her stay No money no babysitters she couldn't keep a job She tried to sell crack but ended up gettin' robbed So now what's next there ain't nothin' left to sell So she sees sex as her way of leavin' hell It's payin' the rent so she really can't complain Prostitute found slain and Brenda's her name She's got a baby  Baby

used like toys   My mind is dead everybody loves me  Wants a slice of me  Hopelessly passive and compatible  Need to belong oh the roads are scary  So hold me in your arms  I wanna be your only possession  Used used used by men Used used used by men  All they leave behind is money  Paper made out of broken twisted trees  Your pretty face offends  Because it's something real that I can't touch  Eyes skin bone contour language as a flower   No god reached me faded films and loving books  Black and white TV  All the world does not exist for me  If I'm starving you can feed me lollipops  Your diet will crush me  My life just an old man's memory  Little baby nothing  Loveless slavery lips kissing empty  Dress your life in loathing  Breaking your mind with Barbie Doll futility   Little baby nothing  Sexually free made-up to breakup  Assassinated beauty  Moths broken up quenched at last  The vermin allowed a thought to pass them by   You are pure you are snow  We are the useless sluts that they mould  Rock 'n' roll is our epiphany  Culture alienation boredom and despair   You are pure you are snow  We are the useless sluts that they mould  Rock 'n' roll is our epiphany
