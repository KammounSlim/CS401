Somethin' that's far above average."" And maybe other rhyming words like cabbage and savage And baby carriage and other things that match it Couple of things are happenin' here First he's relatin' the word bitch with his mama - comma And because she's relatin' to herself As most important source of help And mental health he may skew respect for dishonor Bitch bad woman good Lady better they misunderstood (I'm killin' these bitches) Uh tell 'em bitch bad Woman good lady better They misunderstood They misunderstood Yeah now imagine a group of little girls 9 through 12 On the Internet watching videos Listening to songs by themselves It doesn't really matter if they have parental clearance They understand the Internet better than their parents Now being the Internet the content's probably uncensored They're young so they're malleable and probably unmentored A complicated combination maybe with no relevance Until that intelligence meets their favorite singer's preference ""Bad bitches bad bitches bad bitches That's all I want and all I like in life is bad bitches bad bitches.""

somebody to come and set me free I don't wanna be like Snow White waiting For a handsome prince to come and save me I don't want a ride Unless we're riding side by side Don't wanna depend on no one else I'd rather rescue myself VERSE 2 Some day I'm gonna find someone who wants me body soul heart and mind Who's not afraid to show that he loves me Somebody who will understand I'm happy just the
