1,I guess it was yourself you were involved with I would have sworn it was me I might have found out sooner if You'd only let me close enough to see That ain't no way to treat a lady No way to treat your baby Your woman your friend That ain't no way to treat a lady no way But maybe it's a way for us to end I was only bein' a picture With all the colors I know While you were busy looking into Wide blue mirrors and lovin' the show That ain't no way to treat a lady No way to treat your baby Your woman your friend That ain't no way to treat a lady no way But maybe it's a way for us to end There's a funny kind of consolation Keepin' me sane And I'd really like to share it Crawl on deep in my brain You see the time you never felt me Lovin' you or needin' you So leavin' you now You still won't know how to feel the pain I was lookin' out for my happiness While you were looking within And before you know your own reflection Always starts to tire you and it's happened again That ain't no way to treat a lady No way to treat your baby Your woman your friend That ain't no way to treat a lady no way But maybe it's a way for us to end That ain't no way to treat a lady No way to treat your baby Your woman your friend That ain't no way to treat a lady no way But maybe it's a way for us to end,1

5,"Hit it This ain't no disco It ain't no country club either This is L.A. ""All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die"" Says the man next to me out of nowhere It's apropos of nothing he says his name is William But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy And he's plain ugly to me And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday In a bar that faces a giant car wash The good people of the world Are washing their cars on their lunch break Hosing and scrubbing as best they can in skirts in suits They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks Back to the phone company the record store too Well they're nothing like Billy and me 'Cause all I wanna do is have some fun I got a feeling I'm not the only one All I wanna do is have some fun I got a feeling I'm not the only one All I wanna do is have some fun Until the sun comes up Over Santa Monica Boulevard I like a good beer buzz early in the morning And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud He shreds them on the bar then he lights every match In an oversized pack letting each one burn Down to his thick fingers before blowing and cursing them out And he's watching the bottles of Bud As they spin on the floor And a happy couple enters the bar Dangerously close to one another The bartender looks up from his want ads But all I wanna do is have some fun I got a feeling I'm not the only one All I wanna do is have some fun I got a feeling I'm not the only one All I wanna do is have some fun Until the sun comes up Over Santa Monica Boulevard Otherwise the bar is ours The day and the night and the car wash too The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars The sun and the moon But all I wanna do is have some fun I got a feeling I'm not the only one All I wanna do is have some fun I got a feeling the party has just begun All I wanna do is have some fun I won't tell you that you're the only one All I wanna do is have some fun Until the sun comes up Over Santa Monica Boulevard Until the sun comes up Over Santa Monica Boulevard",1
6,He's home again from another day She smiles at him as he walks through the door She wonders if it will be okay It's hard for her when he doesn't respond He says babe you look a mess You look dowdy in that dress It's just not like it used to be Then she says... I may not be a lady But I'm all woman From monday to sunday I work harder than you know I'm no classy lady But I'm all woman And this woman needs a little love to make her strong You're not the only one She stands there and lets the tears flow Tears that she's been holding back so long She wonders where did all the loving go The love they used to share when they were strong She says yes I look a mess But I don't love you any less I thought you always thought enough of me to always be impressed I may not be a lady But I'm all woman From monday to sunday I work harder than you know I'm no classy lady But I'm all woman And this woman needs a little love to make her strong You're not the only one He holds her and hangs his head in shame He doesn't see her like he used to do He's too wrapped up in working for his pay He hasn't seen the pain he's put her through Attention that he paid Just vanished in the haze He remembers how it used to be When he used to say You'll always be a lady 'Cos you're all woman From monday to sunday I love you much more than you know You're a classy lady 'Cos you're all woman This woman needs a loving man to keep her warm You're the only one You're a classy lady 'Cos you're all woman So sweet the love that used to be So sweet the love that used to be We can be sweet again...,1

16,"Yeah I say bitch bad Woman good lady better Hey hey hey hey Now imagine there's a shorty maybe five maybe four Riding 'round with his mama listening to the radio And a song comes on and a not far off from being born Doesn't know the difference between right and wrong Now I ain't trying to make it too complex But let's just say shorty has an undeveloped context About the perception of women these days His mama sings along and this what she says ""Niggas I'm a bad bitch and I'm bad bitch! Somethin' that's far above average."" And maybe other rhyming words like cabbage and savage And baby carriage and other things that match it Couple of things are happenin' here First he's relatin' the word bitch with his mama - comma And because she's relatin' to herself As most important source of help And mental health he may skew respect for dishonor Bitch bad woman good Lady better they misunderstood (I'm killin' these bitches) Uh tell 'em bitch bad Woman good lady better They misunderstood They misunderstood Yeah now imagine a group of little girls 9 through 12 On the Internet watching videos Listening to songs by themselves It doesn't really matter if they have parental clearance They understand the Internet better than their parents Now being the Internet the content's probably uncensored They're young so they're malleable and probably unmentored A complicated combination maybe with no relevance Until that intelligence meets their favorite singer's preference ""Bad bitches bad bitches bad bitches That's all I want and all I like in life is bad bitches bad bitches."" Now let's say that they less concerned with him And more with the video girl acquiescent to his whims Ah the plot thickens: high heels long hair fat booty slim Reality check I'm not trippin' They don't see a paid actress just what makes a bad bitch Bitch bad woman good Lady better they misunderstood (I'm killin' these bitches) I say I say I say I say I say I say Bitch bad woman good Lady better they misunderstood (I'm killin' these bitches) Disclaimer: this rhymer Lupe is not using ""bitch"" as a lesson But as a psychological weapon To set in your mind and really mess with your conceptions Discretions reflections it's clever misdirection 'Cause while I was rappin' they was growin' up fast Nobody stepped in to ever slow 'em up gasp Sho' enough in this little world The little boy meets one of those little girls And he thinks she a bad bitch and she thinks she a bad bitch He thinks disrespectfully she thinks of that sexually She got the wrong idea he don't wanna fuck her He think she's bad at being a bitch like his mother Momma never dressed like that Come out the house hot mess like that Ass titties dressed like that all out to impress like that Just like that you see the fruit of the confusion He caught in a reality she caught in an illusion Bad mean good to her she really nice and smart But bad mean bad to him bitch don't play a part But bitch still bad to her if you say it the wrong way But she think she a bitch; what a double entendre! Tell 'em bitch bad woman good Lady better they misunderstood I say I say I say I say I say I say Bitch bad woman good Lady better they misunderstood They misunderstood Bitch bad woman good Lady better they misunderstood You're misunderstood (I'm killin' these bitches) Bitch bad woman good Lady better greatest motherhood (I'm killin' these bitches)",1

109,No one likes looking at you  Your lack of ego offends male mentality  They need your innocence  To steal vacant love and to destroy  Your beauty and virginity used like toys   My mind is dead everybody loves me  Wants a slice of me  Hopelessly passive and compatible  Need to belong oh the roads are scary  So hold me in your arms  I wanna be your only possession  Used used used by men Used used used by men  All they leave behind is money  Paper made out of broken twisted trees  Your pretty face offends  Because it's something real that I can't touch  Eyes skin bone contour language as a flower   No god reached me faded films and loving books  Black and white TV  All the world does not exist for me  If I'm starving you can feed me lollipops  Your diet will crush me  My life just an old man's memory  Little baby nothing  Loveless slavery lips kissing empty  Dress your life in loathing  Breaking your mind with Barbie Doll futility   Little baby nothing  Sexually free made-up to breakup  Assassinated beauty  Moths broken up quenched at last  The vermin allowed a thought to pass them by   You are pure you are snow  We are the useless sluts that they mould  Rock 'n' roll is our epiphany  Culture alienation boredom and despair   You are pure you are snow  We are the useless sluts that they mould  Rock 'n' roll is our epiphany  Culture alienation boredom and despair ,1

206,Crashed on the floor when I moved in This little bungalow with some strange new friends Stay up too late and I'm too thin We promise each other it's til the end Now we're spinning empty bottles It's the five of us With pretty eyed boys girls die to trust I can't resist the day No I can't resist the day Jenny screams out and it's no pose 'Cause when she dances she goes and goes Beer through the nose on an inside joke I'm so excited I haven't spoken And she's so pretty and she's so sure Maybe I'm more clever than a girl like her The summer's all in bloom The summer is ending soon It's alright and it's nice not to be so alone But I hold on to your secrets in white houses Maybe I'm a little bit over my head I come undone at the things he said And he's so funny in his bright red shirt We were all in love and we all got hurt I sneak into his car's cracked leather seat The smell of gasoline in the summer heat Boy we're going way too fast It's all too sweet to last It's alright And I put myself in his hands But I hold on to your secrets in white houses Love or something ignites in my veins And I pray it never fades in white houses My first time hard to explain Rush of blood oh and a little bit of pain On a cloudy day it's more common than you think He's my first mistake Maybe you were all faster than me We gave each other up so easily These silly little wounds will never mend I feel so far from where I've been So I go and I will not be back here again I'm gone as the day is fading on white houses I lie wrote my injuries all in the dust In my heart it's the five of us In white houses And you maybe you'll remember me What I gave is yours to keep In white houses In white houses In white houses,1

357,"load ""Cleanin Out My Clos..."" Ringtone ""Cleanin Out My Closet"" Where's my snare? I have no snare in my headphones - there you go Yeah... yo yo Have you ever been hated or discriminated against? I have; I've been protested and demonstrated against Picket signs for my wicked rhymes look at the times Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind All this commotion emotions run deep as ocean's exploding Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going Not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing Keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth See they can trigger me but they'll never figure me out Look at me now; I bet ya probably sick of me now ain't you momma? I'mma make you look so ridiculous now I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry; but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) I said I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet Ha! I got some skeletons in my closet And I don't know if no one knows it So before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it I'mma expose it; I'll take you back to '73 Before I ever had a multi-platinum selling CD I was a baby maybe I was just a couple of months My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch Cause he split I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye No I don't. On second thought I just fucking wished he would die I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leaving her side Even if I hated Kim I grit my teeth and I'd try To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake I maybe made some mistakes But I'm only human but I'm man enough to face them today What I did was stupid no doubt it was dumb But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun Cause I'da killed him; shit I would've shot Kim and him both It's my life I'd like to welcome y'all to ""The Eminem Show"" I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry; but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) I said I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet Now I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissing But put yourself in my position; just try to envision Witnessing your momma popping prescription pills in the kitchen Bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing Going through public housing systems victim of Munchhausen's Syndrome My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 'Til I grew up now I blew up it makes you sick to ya stomach Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma? So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma? But guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony And Hailie's getting so big now; you should see her she's beautiful But you'll never see her - she won't even be at your funeral! See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong Bitch do your song - keep telling yourself that you was a mom! But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get You selfish bitch; I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? Well guess what I am dead - dead to you as can be! I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry; but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) I said I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you!

And as we wind on down the road Our shadows taller than our soul There walks a lady we all know Who shines white light and wants to show How everything still turns to gold And if you listen very hard The tune will come to you at last When all are one and one is all To be a rock and not to roll And she's buying a stairway to heaven,0

409,Breathe breathe in the air Don't be afraid to care Leave but don't leave me Look around and choose your own ground For long you live and high you fly Smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry And all you touch and all you see Is all your life will ever be Run run rabbit run Dig that hole forget the sun And when at last the work is done Don't sit down it's time to dig another one For long you live and high you fly But only if you ride the tide And balanced on the biggest wave You race towards an early grave,0
410,Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day Fritter and waste the hours in an off hand way. Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town Waiting for someone or something to show you the way ... Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain. And you are young and life is long and there is time to kill today. And then one day you find ten years have got behind you. No one told you when to run you missed the starting gun. Ahhhh... (Oooh ahhhh) So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking Racing around to come up behind you again. The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older Shorter of breath and one day closer to death. Every year is getting shorter; never seem to find the time. Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines. Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way The time is gone the song is over Thought I'd something more to say. Home Home again I like to be here When I can When I come home Cold and tired It's good to warm my bones Beside the fire Far away Across the field Tolling on the iron bell Calls the faithful to their knees To hear the softly spoken magic spell,0
411,I can see you in the morning when you go to school Don't forget your books you know you've got to learn the golden rule Teacher tells you stop your play and get on with your work And be like Johnnie - too-good don't you know he never shirks he's coming along! After School is over you're playing in the park Don't be out too late don't let it get too dark They tell you not to hang around and learn what life's about And grow up just like them - won't you let it work it out and you're full of doubt Don't do this and don't do that What are they trying to do? Make a good boy of you Do they know where it's at? Don't criticise they're old and wise Do as they tell you to Don't want the devil to Come and put out your eyes Maybe I'm mistaken expecting you to fight Or maybe I'm just crazy I don't know wrong from right But while I am still living I've just got this to say It's always up to you if you want to be that want to see that want to see it that way - you're coming along!,0
412,"You get a shiver in the dark It's raining in the park but meantime South of the river you stop and you hold everything A band is blowing Dixie double four time You feel alright when you hear that music ring Well now you step inside but you don't see too many faces Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down Competition in other places Ah but the horns they blowing that sound Way on down south way on down south London town You check out Guitar George he knows all the chords Mind he's strictly rhythm he doesn't want to make it cry or sing Yes and an old guitar is all he can afford When he gets up under the lights to play his thing And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene He's got a daytime job he's doing alright He can play the honky tonk like anything Saving it up for Friday night With the Sultans with the Sultans of Swing And a crowd of young boys they're fooling around in the corner Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band It ain't what they call rock and roll Then the Sultans yeah the Sultans they play Creole Creole And then the man he steps right up to the microphone And says at last just as the time bell rings ""Goodnight now it's time to go home"" Then he makes it fast with one more thing ""We are the Sultans we are the Sultans of Swing""",0
413,Now here you go again You say you want your freedom Well who am I to keep you down? It's only right that you should Play the way you feel it But listen carefully to the sound Of your loneliness Like a heartbeat.. drives you mad In the stillness of remembering what you had And what you lost... And what you had... And what you lost  Thunder only happens when it's raining Players only love you when they're playing Say... Women... they will come and they will go When the rain washes you clean... you'll know you'll know Now here I go again I see the crystal visions I keep my visions to myself It's only me Who wants to wrap around your dreams and... Have you any dreams you'd like to sell? Dreams of loneliness... Like a heartbeat... drives you mad... In the stillness of remembering what you had... And what you lost... And what you had... And what you lost ,0
414,These mist covered mountains Are a home now for me But my home is the lowlands And always will be Some day you'll return to Your valleys and your farms And you'll no longer burn To be brothers in arms Through these fields of destruction Baptisms of fire I've witnessed your suffering As the battles raged higher And though they hurt me so bad In the fear and alarm You did not desert me My brothers in arms There's so many different worlds So many different suns And we have just one world But we live in different ones Now the sun's gone to hell And the moon's riding high Let me bid you farewell Every man has to die But it's written in the starlight And every line in your palm We're fools to make war On our brothers in arms,0
415,Hello darkness my old friend I've come to talk with you again Because a vision softly creeping Left its seeds while I was sleeping And the vision that was planted in my brain Still remains Within the sound of silence. In restless dreams I walked alone Narrow streets of cobblestone 'Neath the halo of a street lamp I turned my collar to the cold and damp When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light That split the night And touched the sound of silence. And in the naked light I saw Ten thousand people maybe more. People talking without speaking People hearing without listening People writing songs that voices never share And no one dare Disturb the sound of silence. 'Fools' said I 'You do not know Silence like a cancer grows. Hear my words that I might teach you Take my arms that I might reach you.' But my words like silent raindrops fell And echoed In the wells of silence And the people bowed and prayed To the neon god they made. And the sign flashed out its warning in the words that it was forming. And the sign said 'The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls And tenement halls. And whispered in the sounds of silence.',0
416,On the first part of the journey I was looking at all the life There were plants and birds and rocks and things There was sand and hills and rings The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz And the sky with no clouds The heat was hot and the ground was dry But the air was full of sound I've been through the desert on a horse with no name It felt good to be out of the rain In the desert you can't remember your name 'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain La la la la la la la la la la la After two days in the desert sun My skin began to turn red After three days in the desert fun I was looking at a river bed And the story it told of a river that flowed Made me sad to think it was dead You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name It felt good to be out of the rain In the desert you can't remember your name 'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain La la After nine days I let the horse run free 'Cause the desert had turned to sea There were plants and birds and rocks and things There was sand and hills and rings The ocean is a desert with it's life underground And a perfect disguise above Under the cities lies a heart made of ground But the humans will give no love You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name It felt good to be out of the rain In the desert you can't remember your name 'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain La la la la la la la la la la la,0

And you wanna think that I will not vanish and you will not scare me Try to get through it try to bounce to it All the while thinking I might as well do it They be lovin' someone and I'm not that stupid Take the next ticket to take the next train Why would I do it? And you wanna think that I will not vanish and you will not scare me Try to get through it try to bounce to it All the while thinking I might as well do it They be lovin' someone and I'm not that stupid Take the next ticket to take the next train Why would I do it? And you wanna think that Baby now I'm ready moving on Oh but maybe I was ready all along Oh I'm ready for the moment and the sound Oh but maybe I was ready all along Baby now I'm ready moving on Oh but maybe I was ready all along Oh I'm ready for the moment and the sound Oh but maybe I was ready all along,0
456,You were a child Crawling on your knees toward it Making momma so proud But your voice is too loud We like to watch you laughing You pick the insects off plants No time to think of consequences Control yourself Take only what you need from it A family of trees wanting To be haunted Control yourself Take only what you need from it A family of trees wanting To be haunted The water is warm But it's sending me shivers A baby is born Crying out for attention The memories fade Like looking through a fogged mirror Decision to decisions are made And not bought But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot I guess not Control yourself Take only what you need from it A family of trees wanting To be haunted Control yourself Take only what you need from it A family of trees wanting To be haunted Control yourself Take only what you need from it A family of trees wanting To be haunted Control yourself Take only what you need from it A family of trees wanting To be haunted Control yourself Take only what you need from it A family of trees wanting To be haunted Control yourself Take only what you need from it A family of trees,0

Plans to have a winter ball for you to throw But just where or when he never lets you know If it's snow or clear days you'll find  And so you wait to see what he'll do Is it sun or snow for you But it breaks your heart in two Cause you've been fooled by April  And he's gone And he's gone Winter's gone  You find it's October And she's gone And she's gone Summer's gone  You've been fooled by April And he's gone And he's gone Winter's gone  You find it's October And she's gone And she's gone Summer's gone  You've been fooled by April And he's gone And he's gone Winter's gone ,0

568,It's a mystery to me the game commences For the usual fee plus expenses Confidential information it's in a diary This is my investigation it's not a public inquiry I go checking out the reports digging up the dirt You get to meet all sorts in this line of work Treachery and treason there's always an excuse for it And when I find the reason I still can't get used to it And what have you got at the end of the day? What have you got to take away? A bottle of whiskey and a new set of lies Blinds on the windows and a pain behind the eyes Scarred for life no compensation Private investigations,0
569,"A long time ago came a man on a track Walking thirty miles with a sack on his back And he put down his load where he thought it was the best He made a home in the wilderness He built a cabin and a winter store And he plowed up the ground by the cold lake shore And the other travelers came walking down the track And they never went further and they never went back III Then came the churches then came the schools Then came the lawyers and then came the rules Then came the trains and the trucks with their loads And the dirty old track was the telegraph road Then came the mines then came the ore Then there was the hard times then there was a war Telegraph sang a song about the world outside Telegraph road got so deep and so wide Like a rolling river And my radio says tonight it's gonna freeze People driving home from the factories There's six lanes of traffic Three lanes moving slow I used to like to go to work but they shut it down I've got a right to go to work but there's no work here to be found Yes and they say we're gonna have to pay what's owed We're gonna have to reap from some seed that's been sowed And the birds up on the wires and the telegraph poles They can always fly away from this rain and this cold You can hear them singing out their telegraph code All the way down the telegraph road You know I'd sooner forget but I remember those nights When life was just a bet on a race between the lights You had your head on my shoulder you had your hand in my hair Now you act a little colder like you don't seem to care But believe in me baby and I'll take you away From out of this darkness and into the day From these rivers of headlights these rivers of rain From the anger that lives on the streets with these names 'Cause I've run every red light on memory lane I've seen desperation explode into flames And I don't want to see it again From all of these signs saying ""sorry but we're closed"" All the way Down the telegraph road",0
