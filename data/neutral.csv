And still those voices are calling from far away Wake you up in the middle of the night Just to hear them say  Welcome to the Hotel California Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place) Such a lovely face They livin' it up at the Hotel California What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise) Bring your alibis  Mirrors on the ceiling The pink champagne on ice And she said ""We are all just prisoners here of our own device"" And in the master's chambers They gathered for the feast They stab it with their steely knives But they just can't kill the beast  Last thing I remember I was running for the door I had to find the passage back to the place I was before ""Relax"" said the night man ""We are programmed to receive You can check-out any time you like But you can never leave!""

(...),Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come followin' you  Though I know that evening's empire Has returned into sand Vanished from my hand Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping  My weariness amazes me I am branded on my feet I have no one to meet And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming  Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come followin' you  Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship My senses have been stripped my hands can't feel to grip My toes too numb to step Wait only for my boot heels to be wandering  I'm ready to go anywhere I'm ready for to fade Into my own parade Cast your dancing spell my way I promise to go under it  Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come followin' you  Though you might hear laughing spinning swinging madly across the sun It's not aimed at anyone It's just escaping on the run And but for the sky there are no fences facing  And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme To your tambourine in time It's just a ragged clown behind I wouldn't pay it any mind It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing  Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come followin' you  Then take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind Down the foggy ruins of time far past the frozen leaves The haunted frightened trees out to the windy beach Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow  Yes to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free Silhouetted by the sea circled by the circus sands With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves Let me forget about today until tomorrow  Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come followin' you ,Blackbird singing in the dead of night Take these broken wings and learn to fly All your life You were only waiting for this moment to arise  Blackbird singing in the dead of night Take these sunken eyes and learn to see All your life You were only waiting for this moment to be free  Blackbird fly Blackbird fly Into the light of the dark black night  Blackbird fly Blackbird fly Into the light of the dark black night  Blackbird singing in the dead of night Take these broken wings and learn to fly All your life You were only waiting for this moment to arise You were only waiting for this moment to arise You were only waiting for this moment to arise ,Breathe breathe in the air Don't be afraid to care Leave but don't leave me Look around and choose your own ground For long you live and high you fly Smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry And all you touch and all you see Is all your life will ever be Run run rabbit run Dig that hole forget the sun And when at last the work is done Don't sit down it's time to dig another one For long you live and high you fly But only if you ride the tide And balanced on the biggest wave You race towards an early grave,Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day Fritter and waste the hours in an off hand way. Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town Waiting for someone or something to show you the way ... Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain. And you are young and life is long and there is time to kill today. And then one day you find ten years have got behind you. No one told you when to run you missed the starting gun. Ahhhh... (Oooh ahhhh) So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking Racing around to come up behind you again. The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older Shorter of breath and one day closer to death. Every year is getting shorter; never seem to find the time. Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines. Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way The time is gone the song is over Thought I'd something more to say. Home Home again I like to be here When I can When I come home Cold and tired It's good to warm my bones Beside the fire Far away Across the field Tolling on the iron bell Calls the faithful to their knees To hear the softly spoken magic spell,I can see you in the morning when you go to school Don't forget your books you know you've got to learn the golden rule Teacher tells you stop your play and get on with your work And be like Johnnie - too-good don't you know he never shirks he's coming along! After School is over you're playing in the park Don't be out too late don't let it get too dark They tell you not to hang around and learn what life's about And grow up just like them - won't you let it work it out and you're full of doubt Don't do this and don't do that What are they trying to do? Make a good boy of you Do they know where it's at? Don't criticise they're old and wise Do as they tell you to Don't want the devil to Come and put out your eyes Maybe I'm mistaken expecting you to fight Or maybe I'm just crazy I don't know wrong from right But while I am still living I've just got this to say It's always up to you if you want to be that want to see that want to see it that way - you're coming along!,"You get a shiver in the dark It's raining in the park but meantime South of the river you stop and you hold everything A band is blowing Dixie double four time You feel alright when you hear that music ring Well now you step inside but you don't see too many faces Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down Competition in other places Ah but the horns they blowing that sound Way on down south way on down south London town You check out Guitar George he knows all the chords Mind he's strictly rhythm he doesn't want to make it cry or sing Yes and an old guitar is all he can afford When he gets up under the lights to play his thing And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene He's got a daytime job he's doing alright He can play the honky tonk like anything Saving it up for Friday night With the Sultans with the Sultans of Swing And a crowd of young boys they're fooling around in the corner Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band It ain't what they call rock and roll Then the Sultans yeah the Sultans they play Creole Creole And then the man he steps right up to the microphone And says at last just as the time bell rings ""Goodnight now it's time to go home"" Then he makes it fast with one more thing ""We are the Sultans we are the Sultans of Swing""",Now here you go again You say you want your freedom Well who am I to keep you down? It's only right that you should Play the way you feel it But listen carefully to the sound Of your loneliness Like a heartbeat.. drives you mad In the stillness of remembering what you had And what you lost... And what you had... And what you lost  Thunder only happens when it's raining Players only love you when they're playing Say... Women... they will come and they will go When the rain washes you clean... you'll know you'll know Now here I go again I see the crystal visions I keep my visions to myself It's only me Who wants to wrap around your dreams and... Have you any dreams you'd like to sell? Dreams of loneliness... Like a heartbeat... drives you mad... In the stillness of remembering what you had... And what you lost... And what you had... And what you lost ,These mist covered mountains Are a home now for me But my home is the lowlands And always will be Some day you'll return to Your valleys and your farms And you'll no longer burn To be brothers in arms Through these fields of destruction Baptisms of fire I've witnessed your suffering As the battles raged higher And though they hurt me so bad In the fear and alarm You did not desert me My brothers in arms There's so many different worlds So many different suns And we have just one world But we live in different ones Now the sun's gone to hell And the moon's riding high Let me bid you farewell Every man has to die But it's written in the starlight And every line in your palm We're fools to make war On our brothers in arms,Hello darkness my old friend I've come to talk with you again Because a vision softly creeping Left its seeds while I was sleeping And the vision that was planted in my brain Still remains Within the sound of silence. In restless dreams I walked alone Narrow streets of cobblestone 'Neath the halo of a street lamp I turned my collar to the cold and damp When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light That split the night And touched the sound of silence. And in the naked light I saw Ten thousand people maybe more. People talking without speaking People hearing without listening People writing songs that voices never share And no one dare Disturb the sound of silence. 'Fools' said I 'You do not know Silence like a cancer grows. Hear my words that I might teach you Take my arms that I might reach you.' But my words like silent raindrops fell And echoed In the wells of silence And the people bowed and prayed To the neon god they made. And the sign flashed out its warning in the words that it was forming. And the sign said 'The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls And tenement halls. And whispered in the sounds of silence.',On the first part of the journey I was looking at all the life There were plants and birds and rocks and things There was sand and hills and rings The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz And the sky with no clouds The heat was hot and the ground was dry But the air was full of sound I've been through the desert on a horse with no name It felt good to be out of the rain In the desert you can't remember your name 'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain La la la la la la la la la la la After two days in the desert sun My skin began to turn red After three days in the desert fun I was looking at a river bed And the story it told of a river that flowed Made me sad to think it was dead You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name It felt good to be out of the rain In the desert you can't remember your name 'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain La la After nine days I let the horse run free 'Cause the desert had turned to sea There were plants and birds and rocks and things There was sand and hills and rings The ocean is a desert with it's life underground And a perfect disguise above Under the cities lies a heart made of ground But the humans will give no love You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name It felt good to be out of the rain In the desert you can't remember your name 'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain La la la la la la la la la la la,Unfortunately we are not licensed to display the full lyrics for this song at the moment.

It's not always easy and Sometimes life can be deceiving I'll tell you one thing it's always better when we're together Mmm its always better when we're together Yeah we look at the stars when we're together Well It's always better when we're together Yeah it's always better when we're together And all of these moments Just might find their way into my dreams tonight But I know that they'll be gone When the morning light sings And brings new things But tomorrow night you see That they'll be gone too Too many things I have to do But if all of these dreams might find their way Into my day to day scene I'll be under the impression I was somewhere in between With only two Just me and you Not so many things we got to do Or places we've got to be We'll sit beneath the mango tree now Yeah It's always better when we're together Mmm We're somewhere in between together Well It's always better when we're together Yeah it's always better when we're together Mmmmmm Mmmmmmm Mmmmmm I believe in memories They look so so pretty when I sleep Hey now and when I wake up You look so pretty sleeping next to me But there is not enough time And there is no no song I could sing And there is no combination of words I could say But I will still tell you one thing We're better together,When I find myself in times of trouble Mother Mary comes to me Speaking words of wisdom let it be And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me Speaking words of wisdom let it be Let it be let it be let it be let it be Whisper words of wisdom let it be And when the broken hearted people living in the world agree There will be an answer let it be For though they may be parted there is still a chance that they will see There will be an answer let it be Let it be let it be let it be let it be There will be an answer let it be Let it be let it be let it be let it be Whisper words of wisdom let it be Let it be let it be let it be let it be Whisper words of wisdom let it be And when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me Shine until tomorrow let it be I wake up to the sound of music Mother Mary comes to me Speaking words of wisdom let it be Let it be let it be let it be yeah let it be There will be an answer let it be Let it be let it be let it be yeah let it be Whisper words of wisdom let it be,Come to your river I will come to your river I will come to your river Come to your river (Wash my soul) I will come to your river (Wash my soul) I will come to your river Wash my soul again Carry away my dead leaves Let me baptize my soul with the help of your waters Sink my pains and complains Let the river take them river drown them My ego and my blame Let me baptize my soul with the help of your waters Those all means are so ashamed Let the river take them river drown them Come to your river I will come to your river I will come to your river Come to your river (Wash my soul) I will come to your river (Wash my soul) I will come to your river Wash my soul again Carry away my old leaves Let me baptize my soul with the help of your waters Sink my pains and complains Let the river take them river drown them My ego and my blame Let me baptize my soul with the help of your waters Those all means so ashamed Let the river take them river drown them Come to your river I will come to your river I will come to your river Come to your river (Wash my soul) I will come to your river (Wash my soul) I will come to your river Wash my soul again (speaking in Yoruba language),He said he said He said he said Do you smoke?

A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell? Did they get you to trade Your heroes for ghosts? Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze? Cold comfort for change? And did you exchange A walk on part in the war For a lead role in a cage?

And as we wind on down the road Our shadows taller than our soul There walks a lady we all know Who shines white light and wants to show How everything still turns to gold And if you listen very hard The tune will come to you at last When all are one and one is all To be a rock and not to roll And she's buying a stairway to heaven,Ground Control to Major Tom Ground Control to Major Tom Take your protein pills and put your helmet on Ground Control to Major Tom (Ten nine eight seven six) Commencing countdown engines on (Five four three two) Check ignition and may God's love be with you (Two one liftoff) This is Ground Control to Major Tom You've really made the grade And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare This is Major Tom to Ground Control I'm stepping through the door And I'm floating in the most peculiar way And the stars look very different today For here am I sitting in my tin can Far above the world Planet Earth is blue And there's nothing I can do Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles I'm feeling very still And I think my spaceship knows which way to go Tell my wife I love her very much she knows Ground Control to Major Tom Your circuit's dead there's something wrong Can you hear me Major Tom?

I know that evening's empire Has returned into sand Vanished from my hand Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping  My weariness amazes me I am branded on my feet I have no one to meet And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming  Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come followin' you  Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship My senses have been stripped my hands can't feel to grip My toes too numb to step Wait only for my boot heels to be wandering  I'm ready to go anywhere I'm ready for to fade Into my own parade Cast your dancing spell my way I promise to go under it  Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come followin' you  Though you might hear laughing spinning swinging madly across the sun It's not aimed at anyone It's just escaping on the run And but for the sky there are no fences facing  And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme To your tambourine in time It's just a ragged clown behind I wouldn't pay it any mind It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing  Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come followin' you  Then take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind Down the foggy ruins of time far past the frozen leaves The haunted frightened trees out to the windy beach Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow  Yes to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free Silhouetted by the sea circled by the circus sands With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves Let me forget about today until tomorrow  Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come followin' you ,Blackbird singing in the dead of night Take these broken wings and learn to fly All your life You were only waiting for this moment to arise  Blackbird singing in the dead of night Take these sunken eyes and learn to see All your life You were only waiting for this moment to be free  Blackbird fly Blackbird fly Into the light of the dark black night  Blackbird fly Blackbird fly Into the light of the dark black night  Blackbird singing in the dead of night Take these broken wings and learn to fly All your life You were only waiting for this moment to arise You were only waiting for this moment to arise You were only waiting for this moment to arise ,Breathe breathe in the air Don't be afraid to care Leave but don't leave me Look around and choose your own ground For long you live and high you fly Smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry And all you touch and all you see Is all your life will ever be Run run rabbit run Dig that hole forget the sun And when at last the work is done Don't sit down it's time to dig another one For long you live and high you fly But only if you ride the tide And balanced on the biggest wave You race towards an early grave,Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day Fritter and waste the hours in an off hand way. Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town Waiting for someone or something to show you the way ... Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain. And you are young and life is long and there is time to kill today. And then one day you find ten years have got behind you. No one told you when to run you missed the starting gun. Ahhhh... (Oooh ahhhh) So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking Racing around to come up behind you again. The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older Shorter of breath and one day closer to death. Every year is getting shorter; never seem to find the time. Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines. Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way The time is gone the song is over Thought I'd something more to say. Home Home again I like to be here When I can When I come home Cold and tired It's good to warm my bones Beside the fire Far away Across the field Tolling on the iron bell Calls the faithful to their knees To hear the softly spoken magic spell,I can see you in the morning when you go to school Don't forget your books you know you've got to learn the golden rule Teacher tells you stop your play and get on with your work And be like Johnnie - too-good don't you know he never shirks he's coming along! After School is over you're playing in the park Don't be out too late don't let it get too dark They tell you not to hang around and learn what life's about And grow up just like them - won't you let it work it out and you're full of doubt Don't do this and don't do that What are they trying to do? Make a good boy of you Do they know where it's at? Don't criticise they're old and wise Do as they tell you to Don't want the devil to Come and put out your eyes Maybe I'm mistaken expecting you to fight Or maybe I'm just crazy I don't know wrong from right But while I am still living I've just got this to say It's always up to you if you want to be that want to see that want to see it that way - you're coming along!,"You get a shiver in the dark It's raining in the park but meantime South of the river you stop and you hold everything A band is blowing Dixie double four time You feel alright when you hear that music ring Well now you step inside but you don't see too many faces Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down Competition in other places Ah but the horns they blowing that sound Way on down south way on down south London town You check out Guitar George he knows all the chords Mind he's strictly rhythm he doesn't want to make it cry or sing Yes and an old guitar is all he can afford When he gets up under the lights to play his thing And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene He's got a daytime job he's doing alright He can play the honky tonk like anything Saving it up for Friday night With the Sultans with the Sultans of Swing And a crowd of young boys they're fooling around in the corner Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band It ain't what they call rock and roll Then the Sultans yeah the Sultans they play Creole Creole And then the man he steps right up to the microphone And says at last just as the time bell rings ""Goodnight now it's time to go home"" Then he makes it fast with one more thing ""We are the Sultans we are the Sultans of Swing""",Now here you go again You say you want your freedom Well who am I to keep you down? It's only right that you should Play the way you feel it But listen carefully to the sound Of your loneliness Like a heartbeat.. drives you mad In the stillness of remembering what you had And what you lost... And what you had... And what you lost  Thunder only happens when it's raining Players only love you when they're playing Say... Women... they will come and they will go When the rain washes you clean... you'll know you'll know Now here I go again I see the crystal visions I keep my visions to myself It's only me Who wants to wrap around your dreams and... Have you any dreams you'd like to sell? Dreams of loneliness... Like a heartbeat... drives you mad... In the stillness of remembering what you had... And what you lost... And what you had... And what you lost ,These mist covered mountains Are a home now for me But my home is the lowlands And always will be Some day you'll return to Your valleys and your farms And you'll no longer burn To be brothers in arms Through these fields of destruction Baptisms of fire I've witnessed your suffering As the battles raged higher And though they hurt me so bad In the fear and alarm You did not desert me My brothers in arms There's so many different worlds So many different suns And we have just one world But we live in different ones Now the sun's gone to hell And the moon's riding high Let me bid you farewell Every man has to die But it's written in the starlight And every line in your palm We're fools to make war On our brothers in arms,Hello darkness my old friend I've come to talk with you again Because a vision softly creeping Left its seeds while I was sleeping And the vision that was planted in my brain Still remains Within the sound of silence. In restless dreams I walked alone Narrow streets of cobblestone 'Neath the halo of a street lamp I turned my collar to the cold and damp When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light That split the night And touched the sound of silence. And in the naked light I saw Ten thousand people maybe more. People talking without speaking People hearing without listening People writing songs that voices never share And no one dare Disturb the sound of silence. 'Fools' said I 'You do not know Silence like a cancer grows. Hear my words that I might teach you Take my arms that I might reach you.' But my words like silent raindrops fell And echoed In the wells of silence And the people bowed and prayed To the neon god they made. And the sign flashed out its warning in the words that it was forming. And the sign said 'The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls And tenement halls. And whispered in the sounds of silence.',On the first part of the journey I was looking at all the life There were plants and birds and rocks and things There was sand and hills and rings The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz And the sky with no clouds The heat was hot and the ground was dry But the air was full of sound I've been through the desert on a horse with no name It felt good to be out of the rain In the desert you can't remember your name 'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain La la la la la la la la la la la After two days in the desert sun My skin began to turn red After three days in the desert fun I was looking at a river bed And the story it told of a river that flowed Made me sad to think it was dead You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name It felt good to be out of the rain In the desert you can't remember your name 'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain La la After nine days I let the horse run free 'Cause the desert had turned to sea There were plants and birds and rocks and things There was sand and hills and rings The ocean is a desert with it's life underground And a perfect disguise above Under the cities lies a heart made of ground But the humans will give no love You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name It felt good to be out of the rain In the desert you can't remember your name 'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain La la la la la la la la la la la,Unfortunately we are not licensed to display the full lyrics for this song at the moment.

Woohoo Woohoohoo,These mist covered mountains Are a home now for me But my home is the lowlands And always will be Some day you'll return to Your valleys and your farms And you'll no longer burn To be brothers in arms Through these fields of destruction Baptisms of fire I've witnessed your suffering As the battles raged higher And though they hurt me so bad In the fear and alarm You did not desert me My brothers in arms There's so many different worlds So many different suns And we have just one world But we live in different ones Now the sun's gone to hell And the moon's riding high Let me bid you farewell Every man has to die But it's written in the starlight And every line in your palm We're fools to make war On our brothers in arms,It's a mystery to me the game commences For the usual fee plus expenses Confidential information it's in a diary This is my investigation it's not a public inquiry I go checking out the reports digging up the dirt You get to meet all sorts in this line of work Treachery and treason there's always an excuse for it And when I find the reason I still can't get used to it And what have you got at the end of the day? What have you got to take away? A bottle of whiskey and a new set of lies Blinds on the windows and a pain behind the eyes Scarred for life no compensation Private investigations,"A long time ago came a man on a track Walking thirty miles with a sack on his back And he put down his load where he thought it was the best He made a home in the wilderness He built a cabin and a winter store And he plowed up the ground by the cold lake shore And the other travelers came walking down the track And they never went further and they never went back III Then came the churches then came the schools Then came the lawyers and then came the rules Then came the trains and the trucks with their loads And the dirty old track was the telegraph road Then came the mines then came the ore Then there was the hard times then there was a war Telegraph sang a song about the world outside Telegraph road got so deep and so wide Like a rolling river And my radio says tonight it's gonna freeze People driving home from the factories There's six lanes of traffic Three lanes moving slow I used to like to go to work but they shut it down I've got a right to go to work but there's no work here to be found Yes and they say we're gonna have to pay what's owed We're gonna have to reap from some seed that's been sowed And the birds up on the wires and the telegraph poles They can always fly away from this rain and this cold You can hear them singing out their telegraph code All the way down the telegraph road You know I'd sooner forget but I remember those nights When life was just a bet on a race between the lights You had your head on my shoulder you had your hand in my hair Now you act a little colder like you don't seem to care But believe in me baby and I'll take you away From out of this darkness and into the day From these rivers of headlights these rivers of rain From the anger that lives on the streets with these names 'Cause I've run every red light on memory lane I've seen desperation explode into flames And I don't want to see it again From all of these signs saying ""sorry but we're closed"" All the way Down the telegraph road",,Same Hmm mm Hmm mm Hmm mm What you gonna get For all you've got When you tricked the one you love like...?
