Every day when one's body and mind are at peace one should meditate upon being ripped apart by arrows rifles spears and swords being carried away by surging waves being thrown into the midst of a great fire being struck by lightning being shaken to death by a great earthquake falling from thousand-foot cliffs dying of disease or committing seppuku at the death of one's master. And every day without fail one should consider himself as dead. This is the substance of the Way of the Assassin.,,Is this hard to swallow You keep your thoughts by your pillow Just so you can adore them Just so we can ignore them I'd rather lead not follow I'd rather stay and not go home My moves have got so old or so I've been told But now you've lost it all We're running out of time We've got things on our mind And things we just don't like Who do you want to see?

contemplating what I've seen The bright of the morning that survived the night Dreams remembered in fragments  Shards of glass reflect Shards of glass reflecting the pale of the moon In the pale of the moon  I dance amongst damned this dance of the dead The melodies guiding me playing unheard Dead in the pale of the suffering moon  With this revelation I feel even more at the brink of risk These things in the darkness that I cannot see nor resist Dancing with fire resting in the ash that coats my skin Brings me to life again  Awaken screaming in the darkest of the night The fire heats the sky lifting me into a conscious nightmare Revealing that the window's still intact the murals not defiled The window to the soul has not been broken  Warmth outstanding candlelight the flicker on the wall A better sense of the apathy in the corner of the room The door creaks barely heard as I shiver in my skin The candle dancing violent now as if it somehow has heard  This is vengeance this is beauty somehow defiled This is the culmination of their desire to enter me  What I've seen how quickly white fades to gray Within what fathers the wiles of the devil A farce of this dark memory The wiles of the devil the wiles of the devil Heeding the call  Now I'm a flurry spinning about the room The glass cutting into my feet As I embrace the fall into the floor Descend remember the sound of the whisper In your ear your ear  Now I'm a flurry spinning about the room The glass cutting into my feet As I embrace the fall it crumbles away Descend remember the sound of the whisper In your ear  I stare at the walls alive moving about to a beat I must resist Refusing every advance slipping hopeful back to sleep My eyes shut I sense the cold with whispers in my ear ,,Try to breathe smile as we
