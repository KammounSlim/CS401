Ringtone ""Cleanin Out My Closet"" Where's my snare? I have no snare in my headphones - there you go Yeah... yo yo Have you ever been hated or discriminated against? I have; I've been protested and demonstrated against Picket signs for my wicked rhymes look at the times Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind All this commotion emotions run deep as ocean's exploding Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going Not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing Keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth See they can trigger me but they'll never figure me out Look at me now; I bet ya probably sick of me now ain't you momma? I'mma make you look so ridiculous now I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry; but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) I said I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet Ha!

Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma? So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma? But guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony And Hailie's getting so big now; you should see her she's beautiful But you'll never see her - she won't even be at your funeral! See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong Bitch do your song - keep telling yourself that you was a mom!
