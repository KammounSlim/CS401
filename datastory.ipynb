    "Ever since the beginning of the 20th century, a number of political and social movements have arisen with the goal of empowering women and pushing for social equality of sexes. These movements serve as the foundation of modern day feminism. Numerous feminist ideologies have developed over the past half-century, and the topic certainly represents different viewpoints and aims which spark heated debates of both praises and criticism. Sexism on the other hand, is much less controversial and refers to any prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination on the basis of sex, typically against women. \n",
    "\n",
    "Feminism empowers women, Sexism discriminates against women. The two seemingly opposing dynamics have been explored through various mediums by many aficionados. In this article, instead of approaching the topics from the conventional political, societal, or historical perspectives, we decided to look to music, particularly the lyrics of songs published over the last fifty years (or so) to seek insights. How were women depicted in the 1970s vs. 2000s? Are the images of women different for Rock vs. Rap music? Are there artists that are especially sexist or feminist? We hope to find the answers in the lyrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we used for this project is the <a href=\"https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/\">Million Song Dataset</a> (MSD). However, we discovered that it only provides lyrics in tokenized format, and only includes the most frequently-occurring words. This is not ideal for analysis, and we decided to scrape the Internet for the full lyrics instead. We also looked to several playlists that are labelled as feminist-themed or sexist-themed by users, and used the songs as training data to create a Machine Learning model. The model is then applied to classify the songs in MSD as either Feminist, Sexist, or Neutral. We perform further analysis based on the classification and discuss the findings in thorough detail. \n"

We shall define the meaning of these terms first. Second, what makes the lyrics of a song feminist or sexist? Lastly, how do we detect feminism or sexism in lyrics in order to classify it? We’ll address these questions in this section. \n",

    "Songs that are “explicitly” sexist are the most easily detectable. Explicit sexism is demonstrated by frequent usage of degrading terms towards women. This is commonly observed in Rap music. More subtle sexist songs however, are extremely hard to detect and can sometimes be confused with neutral songs. An example of this would be content such as objectification of women. Feminist lyrics are defined to include songs that portray women in a positive, loving, respectful, or empowering way. Neutral songs have lyrics that are neither sexist nor feminist. These songs either somehow depict women with neither positive nor negative connotation, or have nothing to do with women. \n"

For neutral lyrics, we looked to our own playlists to identify songs that fit the criteria, and scraped the lyrics for those songs. After converting lyrics from text to tf-idf feature vectors, we use scikit learn’s chi-square test to find the top 10 words that are the most correlated to each class. For feminist songs, it includes words like “worth”, “stronger”, “fix”, “respect” and “woman”. For sexist songs, unsurprisingly the list consists of degrading terms. Neutral songs show words that relate to other topics. We will perform the same test to all the songs in MSD we classify using the Machine Learning model we create, and expect to get similar results.

    " Everyone has their own interpretation of feminist or sexist lyrics. To avoid inherent bias that all humans possess, we have decided to let machine do the classification. With four machine learning models that are most commonly used for multi-class classification, we fit the training data to each model and use cross validation to compute the accuracies. The results are shown below, and LinearSVC() model clearly has more superior performance compared to the other three. The confusion matrix for this model is also displayed below. Note that the model generally performs well with the exception that it tends to confuse sexist songs with neutral songs. As mentioned earlier, some sexist lyrics are more subtle and may require a representation more complicated than tf-idf vectorization. We proceed to classification using the LinearSVC() model to complete the dataset we will perform analysis on. It contains 50991 songs, and for each song, in addition to its classification as either feminist, sexist or neutral, it also has the year, genre, artist, and title information.  "

Pop Music is progressive, and tends to reflect changes experienced by the society. There is a clear increasing trend in the proportion of feminist music produced each year for this genre. The increase in presence of feminist songs are likely influenced by several notable Feminism movements that happened during this period of time. From Gloria Steinem's women's liberation movements and Yoko Ono's famous essay, \"The Feminization of Society\" during the 70s, to ladies like Oprah Winfrey, Beyoncé, and Madonna continue to voice their opinions through media and breaking gender stereotypes, pop culture is constantly evolving, and will continue to empower women and encourage them to grow, develop and thrive. \n",

    "Explicit sexism is frowned upon in Pop music and may receive serious PR backlashes. Most artists refrain from demonstrating explicit sexism in their songs, which explains the lack sexist songs in this genre. Many sexist pop songs are disguised as neutral or might even be identified as 'Feminist' by this model. Here's an example: Just the way you are by Bruno Mars. The model will pick up on how women are portrayed in a positive and loving way in this music. However, when a male artist writes a song about how he is deeply attracted to a woman entirely based on her eyes, her hair, her face and her lips, would you say it has a sexist undertone underneath the loving depiction of women? Even though this is beyond the scope of the definition of feminist and sexist within this article, and it would take a much more complicated Machine Learning model to detect, we thought it was an interesting things to consider.

Many songs from the sexist playlists we scraped are Rap songs. We hypothesized that this would be the genre with the highest proportion of sexist songs before any analysis is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rap music originated from African-American youths living in New York in the 1970s. They were disenfranchised, living in low-income areas, and are of marginalized backgrounds. Rap music was their way of coping with tough situations. Their struggles and the political oppression they constantly experience were also reflected in the hip hop culture, as some of the most popular topics rapped about back then included sex and bitches/prostitutes, dollar bills, violence and drugs. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to Mazlov's hierachy of needs, self-fulfillment needs and psychological needs such as achieving one's purpose in life or developing healthy intimate relationships with others only become needs when more basic needs such as safety, security and food needs are satisfied. Many rappers lived in environments that were dangerous or unstable, where women they were exposed to were treated like commodities or some source of income. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is not to say that all rap songs are sexist. Some of the most inspirational lyrics ever written come from rap music. Tupac talks about his struggles in the song, Me Against The World, where he writes that \"No matter how hard it gets, stick your chest out, keep your head up and handle it\". Female rapper Aaliyah also writes in her song Try Again that \"And if at first you don’t succeed then dust yourself off and try again\". Even though the proportion of sexist songs are high in rap music, we see a decrease in percentage over recent years. Though some form of misogyny will still persist in the foreseeable future for such an alpha-male-dominated culture, with emerging artists like Cardi B (yes, she's a feminist),Angel Haze and Princess Nokia expressing themselves and confronting the oppresion faced by women, they are certainly making positive impacts to the hip hop culture. \n",

    "In this article, we have challenged ourselves to analyze the evolution of feminism and sexism throughout the history of music. However, music is art, art is complex, and so are our research questions. We have designed, developped and implemented a dataanalysis and machine learning pipeline to present first insights about this fascinating topic. However, we have had to face several issues that otherwise would have improved our results and widened the scope of our answers. First, we had a limited number training songs: we did not find a sufficient number of feminist/sexist themed songs, and we believe our model's accuracy was negatively affected by this issue. Second, our predictive algorithm was quite simple. It looks for correlation between the label and unigrams and bigrams using the tf-idf ventorized representation of lyrics. One significant shortfall of this method is that the context of such unigram and bigrams are removed from a sentence, and some information is lost in translation. Lastly, we could not figure out a way for Github's hosting website to allow for dynamic widgets and our plotly graphs that allow interaction with users could not be used. The inability to allow for better visualization hinders our ability to deliver clear messages to our audience. Perhaps next time we can work with html which allows for more flexibility with the way plots are presented.\n",
