# Title
Feminism Through Lyrics 

# Abstract
A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?

Feminism focuses on defining, establishing, and achieving political, economic, personal, and social equality of sexes. Number of political and social movements have arisen with this goal in mind since the early 20th century. We are interested in seeing how feminism has impacted the music industry around the world. We would like to explore the progression of feminism since its inception through analyzing the Million Song database provided, specifically the lyrics of songs, with an emphasis of how the image of “women” are being depicted. We would like to investigate how women are portrayed in different genres of music, in different geographical regions in the world, and how it has changed throughout the years. We wonder whether there is a correlation between how women are depicted in lyrics and important political feminism movements, and perhaps the socio-economic status of women across the world may be reflected in the lyrics. 

# Research questions
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project. 

How women are being depicted in the lyrics throughout the history of music (throughout time). 
How the images differ by the regions in the world (U.S. vs. Europen vs. Asian). 
How the images differ by the genre of music, gender of artist etc. 

These are some guidelines of what we would like to explore. 
Before we start exploring, we also need to answer, how do we measure the "image" of women?
How to make the "image" of women quantifiable? Would we like to make it a binary classification problem, 
simply a positive vs. negative image, or more multi-dimensional? 


# Dataset
List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.

Million Song Dataset
Since the data set contains non-English music, the first step would be to extract music that 
contains English to create a subset of the data to work with.
