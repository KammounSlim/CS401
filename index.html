# 1. Milestone 1: Readme

For the data collection, we have based ourselves on the Million Song Dataset. From this huge data, we are only interested in four attributes:
- The track id
- The artist name
- The year
- The title

In addition to that, we are also interested in the genre of the songs. Luckily, in the Million Song Dataset website, there is already a dataset with the track id and the genre. Thus, we downloaded the corresponding file. We have the genre information for around 191'000 songs. Moreover, we have direct access to the 4 attributes through an additional dataset of around 500'000 songs provided in the Million song website. 

We decide to limit our analysis on this dataset for two reasons. First, manipulating the whole million songs dataset is both time consuming and would require the use of the cluster. Second, after a fast and simple instruction, we discovered that around 150'000 of the genre id are already in the subset we have found.

Next, we use some APIs to scrap and collect the lyrics on several websites. However, we could not scrape all of our dataset so far, as one scraping operation takes more than 1 second. The whole scraping of the full set would take more than 55 hours, so we will have to find a method to perform it. The success rate of the scraping code on the 200 more recent songs of the data set was 129/200, which is fair but can still be raised by doing more string processing, for instance removing the "(live)" or "(album version)" strings. For the oldest songs, the success of the scraping is near 0, as the old songs are not usually found in the lyrics websites. This is not a major problem since as shown in our analysis later, the vast majority of the songs are recent ones.
Alternatively, we can use an additional dataset from the million song website containing bag of words data. We would like to avoid this alternative as it is a simple count of words in the songs and it removes them from the context in the songs.

In our notebook, we have performed a first descriptive analysis of the merged datasets. The big proportion ( 41%) of the songs' genre is rock. Moreover, although the values of the year attribute range from 1920 to 2010, 91% of the tracks are from the 1980 to 2010. We believe this is due to the rapid growth of Rock from its birth in the fifties to achieve more than 50% of the music industry in the 70s to 80s. In our notebook, we have a plot showing this evolution. In our analysis, due to the genre unbalance, we will use a random subset of the rock music ( or the decade) to balance out the classes.

# 2. Data Collection and Descriptive Analysis

Using an additional dataset obtained from the million song website that contains genre information, we created genre_dataset. This dataset contains genre information for 191401 songs. The cell below contains code for putting this data into a proper-formatted dataframe. Another helpful dataset obtained from the website of million song dataset is one that contains year the track was released. In addition to year, it also contains track_id, the name of the artist, and title of the track. This dataset contains 515576 data points. Since we wanted to analyze the progression of feminism through lyrics over time, and we were also interested in how women were portrayed in different genres of music, we decided to take the intersection of these datasets (inner join on track ID), and the resulting data frame contains 152793 data points. We save it to a csv file for accessing in the future. 


```python
# Resulting Dataset
year_artist_name_title_genre = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(data_dir + "/year_artist_name_title_genre.csv")).set_index('track_id')
year_artist_name_title_genre.head()

# Percentage of rock songs in the dataset

round(100*year_artist_name_title_genre['genre'].value_counts()['Rock']/year_artist_name_title_genre['genre'].value_counts().sum(),3)
```




    40.803



We see an abundance of Rock music in this dataset as close to half of the songs (40.8 %) present are labelled as Rock music. We wonder why that is. Is Rock Music more likely to get labelled? (<- this is a joke). We suspect that this is due to the fast growth of Rock music during the 1990s and 2000s. We will explore the relationship between year and genre of music further to confirm our hypothesis. 

Let us first have a look at the count of music by time. Since it is impossible to visualize the count for every single year, we first group years into decades. Upon quick analysis we realize that the dataset contains music up to the year 2010. We consider 2010 a part of the 2000s. 


```python
# create decade column
year_artist_name_title_genre['decade'] = (year_artist_name_title_genre['year'] // 10) * 10

# include year 2010 in the 2000s decade
year_artist_name_title_genre['decade'] = np.where(year_artist_name_title_genre.year.isin(['2010']),'2000', 
                                                  year_artist_name_title_genre['decade'])
```


```python
round(100*(year_artist_name_title_genre['decade'].value_counts()['2000'] + \
year_artist_name_title_genre['decade'].value_counts()['1990'] + \
year_artist_name_title_genre['decade'].value_counts()['1980']) / \
year_artist_name_title_genre['decade'].value_counts().sum(),3)
```




    91.361



91% of the tracks are from the eighties to 2010


```python
# plot count using bar plot
value_count_by_year = year_artist_name_title_genre['decade'].value_counts().plot(kind = 'bar')

print(year_artist_name_title_genre['decade'].value_counts())

We see that there are very few data points earlier than 1970, which makes analysis over time biased. During the next few steps as we explore the relationship between genre and decade further, we only consider the time period of 1970 to 2010. 


```python
decade_genre = year_artist_name_title_genre[['decade', 'genre']].reset_index()

decade_genre = decade_genre.loc[decade_genre['decade'].isin(['1970','1980','1990','2000'])]

#print(decade_genre.groupby(['decade', 'genre']).size())
plot_decade_genre = decade_genre.groupby(['decade', 'genre']).size().unstack().plot(kind='bar', stacked = True)
plot_decade_genre.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.1, 1.05) )

```

We see that Rock music grew significantly in 40 years. Rock, Electronic, and Pop are the most popular music during the 2000s, followed by metal and Rap. The next plot considers the genres individually, and illustrates their share in the music market over the period of 1970 to 2010. 


```python
#print(decade_genre.groupby(['genre', 'decade']).size())
decade_genre.groupby(['genre', 'decade']).size().unstack().plot(kind='bar', stacked = True)

The plot is a bitt hard to read. The curve represents the percentage of rock tracks in our dataset through time. We can clearly see that it has increased drastically from the 60s to 2010. We believe that the slight decrease from 90s is due to the increasing success of RNB, rap, pop and Electronic music during that period.


```python
100*decade_rock['Rock']/(year_artist_name_title_genre.groupby('decade').size())

# 3. Getting the lyrics: Bag of words model from musicXmatch

The million songs dataset contains no lyrics. To conduct our study, we have the choice of either scraping the lyrics from the internet for each of the songs of the MSD or to use the ready-to-use bag of words model from musicXmatch.

We first wanted to scrape the lyrics from the internet, using the functions shown below in the notebook.
However, the MSD is too big and scraping the lyrics for our "year_artist_neame_title_genre" dataframe, which contains "only" 152793 tracks, would take us a few days. Moreover, we realized that the NLP would be difficult to handle for this project and decided to do simple statistics and models based on the bag of words provided by musicXmatch, that allowed for very easy processing of the data.

Therefore, the main lyrics dataset we use is the BOW from musicXmatch.
However, we will still use later the scrapping features, as explained later.

This section shows how we read and extract the words from the BOW.


```python
# We read the text file line by line 

with open(os.path.join(data_dir + '/mxm_dataset_train.txt')) as f:
    lines = f.readlines()
```


```python
# The 5'000 most used words sorted by overall occurences are in the 18th line. 
# We split the words by ',' to have a list of words

words = lines[17][1:]
words = words.split(',')
```

Now, for the rest of the file, we have, for each line, a track id and a list of tuplets. A tuplet ( key:value) consists of:
 - a key ( a number ) which represents the identifier of the word ( 1 means the 1st word in our words list etc ).
 - a value which is the occurences of the word in the track.
 
In the following cells, we extract this information and we change the numbered keys to "word keys"


```python
# First, we split to have a list of tracks

bow = lines[18:]
for i in range(0,len(bow)):
    bow[i] = bow[i].split(',')
```

For each track in bow and for each tuplet in the track, extract the key ( the numbers before ':') then replace it by the corresponding word


```python
for i in range(0,len(bow)):
    for j in range(2,len(bow[i])):
        '''
        For each track in bow and for each tuplet in the track, extract the key ( the numbers before ':')
        then replace it by the corresponding word
        '''
        key = bow[i][j][ 0 : bow[i][j].find(':') ]
        bow[i][j] = bow[i][j].replace(key,words[int(key)-1])
        
    # The last tuplet in each track has a line skip special character.
    # The next code will take the last tuplet with the special character
    bow[i][len(bow[i])-1] = bow[i][len(bow[i])-1][0:len(bow[i][len(bow[i])-1])-1]
```


```python
# Extract the track id 

track_id = []
for i in range(0, len(bow)):
    track_id.append(bow[i][0])
```

Now that we have been able to extract and format the BOW information in an useful way, we can start building a model to associate each song with a degree of "positiveness" or "sexism" with respect to the image of women.

# 4. Building a simple model for feminism

## TODO: COMPLETE THE EXPLANATION

We want to build a simple model for feminism. Our method is the following:

1. First we find user defined playlists of **feminist** - or at least positive with respect to women -, **sexist** and **neutral** - with no mention of women or without any positive or negative image of women in the lyrics - songs from the internet.

2. Then, we manually (and painfully) list these songs in this notebook (in the "XXX_to_scrape" lists) and use some custom combination of scraping code to scrape the lyrics associated with these songs. _Note that the songs from the user-defined playlist were not all in the BOW dataset. We wanted to get as many user-defined songs as possible that would no be in the BOW model, to later train our model and apply it to the BOW set._

3. Afterwards, we save the BOW lyrics of the positive, sexist and neutral songs into dataframes. Then, we manually take a look at the BOWs and we identify ourselves what postive or sexist "keywords" are appearing often in the corresponding BOWs. We make sure the identified keywords are relevant for discriminating sexists songs from positive ones, by removing the keywords that appear too often or too sparsely. The result of this operation is a list of positive keywords and a list of sexist keywords, that are manually input into this notebook.

4. Then, we create a feature list from the lists of keywords by adding the positive and sexist keywords lists. For each feature (positive or negative keyword), we count the number of occurences in the user-labeled (positive, sexist or neutral) songs BOWs. This allows us to build a training set on this model, where each song from the training set is labeled as either positive, sexist or neutral with respect to the image of women it depicts, and has a count of the number of occurences of specific keywords.

5. Using your training set, we train a SVM, XXXXX model that can identify feminist, neutral and sexists songs based on their BOWs.

6. Then, we try to train again SVM, XXX and XXX not based on the counts of occurences of keywords but rather on the whole lyrics sentences themselves.

7. After discussing each method, we will be able to label the whole MSD with our trained classifier, identifying feminist, neutral of sexist songs.



## 4.1. Coding some efficient scraping tool

The function "scrape_lyrics" is the main function that allow us to scrape the lyrics from several lyrics websites.


```python
def scrape_lyrics(artists_list,songs_list):
    '''
    Main scrapping function
    Input: lists of songs and their artists names 
    Output: list of lyrics of the songs and list of songs for which the scrapping did not succeed
    In case the scrapping failed, lyrics are returned as empty strings
    
    The lyrics are scrapped from several websites:
    - metrolyrics
    If failed:
    -azlyrics
    If failed also:
    - lyricswikia
    And if it also failed:
    - through the herokuapp online API (unknown source)

## 4.2. Structure the data from the scrapping

Now, we code the "create_BOW_dataframe" to create in practice the BOW dataframe from the artists and titles lists. It calls the "scrape_lyrics" functions, tokenize and stems the words in order to create the BOW.


```python
def create_BOW_lyrics_dataframe(artists_to_scrape, titles_to_scrape, dataframe_csv_file_name):

    if any("," in s for s in titles_to_scrape):
        s.replace(",", "")
    
    if any("," in s for s in artists_to_scrape):
        s.replace(",", "")
    
    # The line below calls the scrapping function
    lyrics, lyrics_not_found_list = scrape_lyrics(artists_to_scrape, titles_to_scrape)

    # Prints relevant information
    print(lyrics_not_found_list)
    print('Count of not found lyrics : ' + str(len(lyrics_not_found_list)))
    
    # Tokenize and stem the lyrics
    from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer
    ps = PorterStemmer()
    
    tokenized_lyrics = []
    
    for lyrics in lyrics:
        tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(lyrics)
        stemmed_tokens = [ps.stem(token) for token in tokens] 
        tokenized_lyrics.append(stemmed_tokens)

    lyrics_df = pd.DataFrame({'Artists': artists_to_scrape,
                                    'Titles': titles_to_scrape,
                                    'Lyrics(BOW)': tokenized_lyrics
                                   })

    # Save the stemmed version of the lyrics with title and artist to csv

    lyrics_df.to_csv(os.path.join(data_dir + dataframe_csv_file_name)) # Comment/uncomment when saving is needed
    
    return tokenized_lyrics, lyrics_df
```


```python
# Define here the name of the dataframe csv in the data folder

sexist_csv = "/sexist_lyrics_dataframe.csv"
positive_csv = "/positive_lyrics_dataframe.csv"
neutral_csv = "/neutral_lyrics_dataframe.csv"
```

## 4.3. Create the positive, neutral and sexist lyrics dataframes
