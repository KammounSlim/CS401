    "Using an additional dataset obtained from the million song website that contains genre information, we created genre_dataset. This dataset contains genre information for 191401 songs. The cell below contains code for putting this data into a proper-formatted dataframe. Another helpful dataset obtained from the website of million song dataset is one that contains year the track was released. In addition to year, it also contains track_id, the name of the artist, and title of the track. This dataset contains 515576 data points. Since we wanted to analyze the progression of feminism through lyrics over time, and we were also interested in how women were portrayed in different genres of music, we decided to take the intersection of these datasets (inner join on track ID), and the resulting data frame contains 152793 data points. We save it to a csv file for accessing in the future. "
